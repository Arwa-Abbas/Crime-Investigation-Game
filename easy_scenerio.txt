EASY LEVEL CASE STUDY SCENERIO

Scenerio: Inside the Monet Art Gallery, people walk around looking at beautiful paintings...
They talk quietly and say nice things about the art. Glasses make a gentle sound when people take sips of champagne....
Soft music from a violin fills the room. Victor Monet, the famous artist everyone came to see, is talking to someone in a quiet corner......
They seem upset, like they're arguing about something. Even though they're speaking quietly, you can feel the tension between them.
It's clear that something isn't right.

All of a sudden, a really loud scream breaks the quietness.....
It's so loud that it stops everyone talking. People look around, surprised and curious, trying to figure out where the scream came from....
The calm and peaceful mood disappears, replaced by a feeling of worry and fear spreading through the crowd....

In all the noise and confusion, something terrible is found.
Victor Monet is lying on the floor, not moving at all......
There's a knife next to him, and it's covered in blood. The gallery looks a mess, with paintings knocked over and art supplies scattered everywhere.
It seems like there was a fight just before. People are shocked and scared as they see what's happened.......
